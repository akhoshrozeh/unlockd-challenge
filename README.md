# Unlockd Challenge (Takehome)

See .pdf in root for specs.<br/>

This project was built with hardhat, so you can use all the normal hardhat commands.<br/>

Just clone this repo, run `npm install`, and then `npx hardhat test` to run the basic functionality test. 

Staking reward mechanics/implementation are based off [this](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/liquidity-mining-on-uniswap-v3) article. <br/>
TL;DR Uses same as synthetix. Rewards of a user are based on their share of the liquidity pool. <br/>
